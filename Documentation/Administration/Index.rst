.. note::

   In case one of the supported extensions is being used it **should be installed prior** installing this distribution.
   This ensures that already predefined records for supported extensions are being imported during installing the
   distribution.

Extension manager
-----------------

Follow these steps to install the distribution through the extension manager:

#. Go to the extension manager
#. Install ``supported extensions`` as needed
#. Select ``Get preconfigured distribution``
#. Search for ``Piz Pal√º Distribution`` and install it

Composer
--------

Adding the extension to a composer based installation:

.. highlight:: bash

::

   composer require buepro/typo3-pizpalue-distribution

Installing TYPO3 with pizpalue-distribution:

.. highlight:: json

::

   {
       "name": "buepro/typo3-cms-pizpalue-distribution",
       "description": "TYPO3 with pizpalue distribution",
       "type": "project",
       "repositories": [
           {
               "type": "composer",
               "url": "https://composer.typo3.org/"
           }
       ],
       "require": {
           "buepro/typo3-pizpalue-distribution": "~11.0"
       },
       "extra": {
           "typo3/cms": {
               "web-dir": "web"
           }
       },
       "license": "MIT",
       "authors": [
           {
               "name": "Name",
               "email": "info@domain.com"
           }
       ],
       "minimum-stability": "stable"
   }

After the distribution has been added install it in the extension manager.

Customization
=============

The suggested way to customize the distribution for customer projects is to create an extension (e.g. user_customer)
and define the customer theme and functions in it (`see TYPO3 documentation
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ExtbaseFluidBook/4-FirstExtension/Index.html>`__).

An example extension for that purpose is delivered and activated with the distribution. You might use it as your
starting point.

   Customize the distribution for customer projects

The extension might be deactivated by removing its static template or by uninstalling it. To prevent the extension
``user_customer`` from being installed the checkbox ``Install customer extension`` in the ``Extension
Configuration`` from the settings module might be deactivated.
